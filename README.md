# CSC 330 Happy Camper

Laura Kaplan, Victoria Jaczynski, Gary Feng

## How to run:
With GUI: Happy Camper should be run from the HappyCamperView class in order to interract with the GUI.
Without GUI: Functionality without the GUI should be tested from the PersonalizedResult class.
Testing Classes: Most classes are set up with their own commented-out main method for individual class testing.
	
	There are 3 file paths which need to be adjusted to the user's specific file-path. They are located in the classes:
		- Weather
		- Campsite
		- ZipCodeDatabase

## About the data and results:
***DATE RANGE: Must be between 06/01/20 and 06/08/20***<br>
User's initial zip code should be a New York state zip code.
Not all dates have good weather. The weather on 06/01/20 and 06/02/20 is particularly cold and rainy.
More campsites available at ranges over 100 miles from NYC.

## Realism Note:
Some campsite names associated with multiple zip codes due to the way we combined our datasets. 
This issue would not be present with more accurate datasets.
